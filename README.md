Tools for transcriptomic analyses

_baton_ includes a variety of convenience functions for common transcriptomic analyses, with a focus on tools for clinical/translational projects. Many of these functions are wrappers around Bioconductor functions to make them more easily integrated with R/tidyverse. Functions are designed to try to follow the unifying principles described here: https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying.html
