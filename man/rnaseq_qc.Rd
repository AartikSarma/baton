\title{Quality control and exploratory analysis for RNAseq count data}
\usage{
rnaseq_qc(
  metadata,
  counts,
  sample_col = "sampleid",
  gene_col = "ensembl_gene_id"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata}{A tibble with sample metadata}

\item{counts}{A tibble with RNAseq counts, with samples as columns}

\item{sample_col}{Name of sample ID column in metadata (default 'sampleid')}

\item{gene_col}{Name of gene ID column in counts (default 'ensembl_gene_id')}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
  \item{qc_metrics}{A tibble with QC metrics per sample}
  \item{plots}{A list containing QC metric plots and PCA and clustering plots}
}
}
\description{
This function performs basic quality control and exploratory analysis 
for RNAseq count data. It takes as input a metadata tibble and a counts tibble
and confirms that the sample IDs match between the two. It renames the gene ID
column in the counts tibble, checks that the remaining columns are numeric, 
and calculates QC metrics including total counts, nonzero counts, and 
ribosomal/mitochondrial percentages per sample. It generates plots for these
QC metrics using ggplot2. It also generates a PCA plot and cluster dendrogram 
for the samples.
